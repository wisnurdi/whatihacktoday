#Learning Laravel

It's very easy to instal laravel. Here what I've learnt yesterday about how to make an application with Laravel Framework.

##Create Application
With composer -- You should know what animal it is -- just type
```
composer create-project laravel/laravel appfolder --prefer-dist
```

By default, after installation process we have file `.env` with generated key, default username and password of mysql database, etc. Next?

##Modif file .env
For my purpose, I just need to modify mysql database name, username, and password. Application is ready now!

##Using artisan to create database migration
By using terminal, we can give command like this
```
php artisan make:migration create_table_kegiatan --create=kegiatans
```
See I give a parameter `create` to force database schema to create a table. Like this:
```
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('kegiatans', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('nama');
            $table->date('mulai');
            $table->date('selesai');
            $table->integer('lama');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```
See that I added 4 fields, `nama`, `mulai`, `selesai`, and `lama`. Field `id` and timestamps are default fields from artisan which create field `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`.

##Using artisan to create default user login and register
It's very easy to create such features: login and register user. Just type this command:
```
php artisan make:auth
```

##Using artisan to create resource controller
Type this command:
```
php artisan make:controller KegiatanController -resource
```
By doing so, artisan give us a controller with name `KegiatanController` including some default methods to be access by application route:
method  | route
======  | =====
index   | GET kegiatan
store   | POST kegiatan
show    | GET kegiatan/{id}
edit    | GET kegiatan/{id}/edit
update  | PUT/PATCH kegiatan
destroy | DELETE kegiatan/{id}
